                            <p> PDF Architects uses computer-aided tools to help them visualise their ideas and build models of their designs. Parametric design software lets architects and designers specify relationships among various parameters of their design model and make changes interactively. Hey r/Architecture! I’ve been on a hunt to get myself a laptop for school starting this August and there have found lots of conflicting information online, probably because people presume about the different functions of a computer and what resources different programs use. So I decided to go and do some research myself to help me (and you!) become better informed about the requirements that we face from our very rigorous work load and hopefully help you get the best bang for your buck. PDF Parametric design techniques offer obvious advantages for engineering and manufacturing processes, now architects emerge to apply these methods in their creation of design suggesting solutions at an earlier stage of the process.
